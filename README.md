# Regression-Analysis-in-R

## Project Name
Regression Analysis for establishing a relation between response and regressor variables.

## Problem Statement
* We are given a [**life expectancy dataset**][2]. We need to solve taks such as
  * 1) Does Life Expectancy have positive or negative relationship with drinking alcohol?
  * 2) Report your relation analysis with the following approaches
        * Simple linear regression analysis.
        * Simple non-linear regression analysis.
  * 3) Calculate R^2 values in each of the above-mentioned case and finally conclude your
results precisely.

## Problem Solution
- We use the knowledge of relational analysis in linear and non-linear regression and work upon the tasks given in the problem statement.
- Finally, we observe our experimental results and conclude them.

## Get Started

The below steps show how to get started with the code running!.
- We need to have R installed in our computer.
- Its better if R studio is also installed for easier code execution.
- The packages mentioned in the top of the code must be intsalled.
- The Life Expectancy Dataset must be downloaded for using/importing it.

By following above steps, the code will start executing smoothly without no errors.
